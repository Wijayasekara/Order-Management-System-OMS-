## ðŸ§¾ Data Profiling Summary

A comprehensive **data profiling process** was conducted for all six OMS datasets (`clients`, `accounts`, `orders`, `executions`, `trades`, and `price_feed`) using the **YData Profiling** library in **Python**.  
This process helped to systematically explore and understand the datasets, identify **data quality issues**, detect **missing or inconsistent values**, and highlight areas that require **cleaning and validation** before building the analytical data model.
