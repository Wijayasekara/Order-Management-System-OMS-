OMS â€” Order Management System Data Engineering Practice Project

ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project simulates a U.S. brokerage Order Management System (OMS) â€” a core platform used by brokers and financial institutions to handle client accounts, trades, and market data.
The goal of this repo is to let data analysts and engineers practice advanced PostgreSQL and data modeling techniques using a realistic, messy dataset that mirrors production scenarios.


ðŸ§© What Is an OMS?

An Order Management System (OMS) is the heart of a trading platform.
It handles the full lifecycle of a financial order â€” from a client placing an order, to its execution, trade settlement, and reporting.

Typical OMS responsibilities:
Manage client & account information
Track orders, executions, and trades
Record cash movements and balances
Integrate market price feeds
Support compliance, audit, and risk management
